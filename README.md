# R2D2-Periscope
**Work in progress** lighting system for the [periscope](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3752279) in Matthew Zwarts lift system.

The lights are mostly 7 LED NeoPixel rings like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0105VMT4S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  These are controlled by an Arduino Nano.

At this time the system is not yet ready to use.
